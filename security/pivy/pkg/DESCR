Pivy is an implementation of a simple PIV client with minimal dependencies.
It contains a pivy-tool binary which can conduct basic operations using
PIV cards, and the pivy-agent, which implements the SSH agent protocol as
a drop-in replacement for the OpenSSH ssh-agent command (except that the
keys it contains are always on a PIV card).

"PIV cards" notably includes Yubico Yubikey devices such as the NEO and
Yubikey4, which can store up to 24 keys by using the "retired key" slots
(which this agent supports).
