Installing the Game Data
========================

To play Hexen2 you need the pak files (pak*.pak) from the original game.
After obtaining them, copy them into ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/uhexen2/data1
or into $HOME/.hexen2/data1 (created when you execute 'glhexen2' or
'hexen2').

Note that the names of the pak files are case sensitive. They must be
all lower-case.

If your pak files need to be patched, then run the `h2patch` tool.

Starting the Game
=================

Type `glhexen2` or `hexen2`.
