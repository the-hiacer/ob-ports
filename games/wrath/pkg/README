wrath
=====
wrath requires the original game files from WRATH: Aeon of Ruin
to work properly. These can come from the GOG.com or Steam versions
of the game.

If you have the GOG version, you need to use innoextract to extract
the data:
$ innoextract setup_wrath_aeon_of_ruin_ea_1.3.1_\(64bit\)_\(38633\).exe

To start wrath, you need to run it in a directory containing the kp1
directory of the game or you can start wrath using the -basedir=
option with a directory containing kp1. For example, if you copy kp1
into a $HOME/.wrath directory:
$ wrath -basedir $HOME/.wrath
