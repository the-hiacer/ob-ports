wrath is the client for the wrath-darkplaces engine used in
WRATH: Aeon of Ruin, a game that embraces the timeless elements
of classic titles such as DOOM, QUAKE, DUKE NUKEM 3D, BLOOD,
UNREAL and HEXEN and carries them into the 21st century.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one
still needs to provide the original game assets from WRATH:
Aeon of Ruin, which is not open source. You will need to
purchase the original game to use this package.
