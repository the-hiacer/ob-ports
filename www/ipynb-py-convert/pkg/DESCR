Atom/Hydrogen or VSCode/Python allows creating a python files split into cells
with # %% separators with the ability to run cells via backend Jupyter session
and interactively show results back. ipynb-py-convert python module converts
files: .ipynb to .py and .py to .ipynb.

This can assist in version controlling ipynb projects, as .py doesn't include
output data.
