lr is a tool for generating file listings, which includes the best features
of ls(1), find(1), stat(1) and du(1).

Benefits over find:
* friendly and logical C-style filter syntax
* getopt is used, can mix filters and arguments in any order
* can sort
* compute directory sizes
* can strip leading ./
* can do breadth first search

Benefits over ls:
* sorts over all files, not per directory
* copy & paste file names from the output since they are relative to pwd
* ISO dates
* powerful filters
