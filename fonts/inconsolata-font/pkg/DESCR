Inconsolata is a monospace font, designed for code listings and the
like, in print. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed
primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the
attention to detail for high resolution rendering.

This version of the font is very old (circa 2009). A newer version
is available in the 'inconsolata-new' package. The new version exposes
bugs in Xft that may make it too wide in some terminals.
