Inconsolata is a monospace font, designed for code listings and the
like, in print. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed
primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the
attention to detail for high resolution rendering.

An older version of this font (circa 2009) is available in the
'inconsolata-font' package. inconsolata-new exposes bugs in Xft that
may make it too wide in some terminals.
