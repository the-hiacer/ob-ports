Work Sans is a 9 weight typeface family based loosely on early
Grotesques, i.e. Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen
Giesserei. The core of the fonts are optimised for on-screen
medium-sized text usage (14px-48px), but still can be used in print
well. The fonts at the extreme weights are designed more for display
use. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen
resolutions, for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they
would be in print.
