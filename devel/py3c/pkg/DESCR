py3c helps you port C extensions to Python 3.

It provides a detailed guide, and a set of macros to make porting easy
and reduce boilerplate.

Design principles
 - Reduce chances of accidental subtle errors
 - Minimize boilerplate
 - Prefer the Python 3 way of doing things
 - Minimize semantic changes under Python 2

Versions
 Projects using py3c will be compatible with CPython 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3+.
